##  codes used to estimate gravity movement and Gini coefficient

1. Gravity_movement

	Matlab codes in this folder were used to estiamte gravity movement of water use, to quantified the contributions of driving factors (i.e., water use scale and intensity) and regions to the spatiotemporal trajectories of water use using the Shapely method.

2. Inequaltiy

	Matlab codes in this folder were used to estiamte Gini coefficient of water use, to calculate the sources of water use inequality,  to asess the inter- and intra-regional effects as well as the prefecture-level influence on water use inequality  though decomposition analysis and a water use demand coefficient (WUDC)
